Usage: ./driver.sh <options>

Script description: Build a Linux kernel image with Clang and boot it

Environment variables:
  The script can take into account specific environment variables, mostly used
  with Travis.  They can be invoked in one of three ways:
    $ export VAR=<value> && ./driver.sh
    $ VAR=value ./driver.sh
    $ ./driver.sh VAR=value

  AR:
      If no AR value is specified, the script will attempt to set AR to
      llvm-ar-9, llvm-ar-8, llvm-ar-7, llvm-ar, then ${CROSS_COMPILE}ar
      if they are found in PATH.
  ARCH:
      If no ARCH value is specified, arm64 is the default. Currently, arm32_v7,
      arm32_v6, arm32_v5, arm64, ppc64le and x86_64 are supported.
  CC:
      If no CC value is specified, the script will attempt to set CC to
      clang-9, clang-8, clang-7, then clang if they are found in PATH.
  LD:
      If no LD value is specified, ${CROSS_COMPILE}ld is used. arm64 only.
  OBJCOPY:
      If no OBJCOPY value is specified, the script will attempt to set OBJCOPY
      to llvm-objcopy-9, llvm-objcopy-8, llvm-objcopy-7, llvm-objcopy, then
      ${CROSS_COMPILE}objcopy if they are found in PATH.
  REPO:
      Nicknames for trees:
        linux (default)
        linux-next
        4.19
        4.14
        4.9
        4.4
        common-4.19
        common-4.14
        common-4.9
        common-4.4

Optional parameters:
  -c | --clean:
      Run 'make mrproper' before building the kernel. Normally, the build
      system is smart enought to figure out what needs to be rebuilt but
      sometimes it might be necessary to clean it manually.
  -j | --jobs
      Pass this value to make. The script will use all cores by default but
      this isn't always the best value.
